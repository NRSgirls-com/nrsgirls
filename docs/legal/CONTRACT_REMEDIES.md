# Contract Remedies Analysis
## NRSgirls.com - Contractor Dispute Resolution

**Document Created:** November 29, 2025
**Contractor:** molohlove (Fiverr Platform)
**Contract Type:** Master Services Agreement for Web Development

---

## I. BREACH ANALYSIS

### A. Nature of Breach

**Classification:** Material Breach / Total Non-Performance

The contractor's delivery constitutes a **material breach** of the Master Services Agreement because:

1. **Complete failure to perform** - No Phase I specifications were delivered
2. **Substitution of inferior product** - Generic GoDaddy template instead of custom development
3. **Fundamental departure from contract** - Delivered work bears no resemblance to specifications
4. **No partial performance** - Cannot identify any contractual requirement that was met

### B. Specific Contract Violations

| Contract Provision | Breach Description |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Custom Development | No custom code delivered; used template builder |
| Technology Stack (Next.js) | GoDaddy builder used instead |
| Phase I Features | Zero of specified features implemented |
| Brand Integration | No logo, tagline, or branding present |
| Functional Requirements | No registration forms, age gate, or disclaimers |
| Infrastructure Setup | No database, no payment system, no hosting config |

---

## II. PAYMENT MILESTONES ANALYSIS

### Payment Structure Review

| Milestone | Description | Amount | Paid? | Work Delivered? |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Project Initiation/Setup | $ | [ ] | [ ] |
| 2 | Design Mockups/Approval | $ | [ ] | [ ] |
| 3 | Phase I Development | $ | [ ] | [ ] |
| 4 | Testing/Deployment | $ | [ ] | [ ] |
| 5 | Final Delivery | $ | [ ] | [ ] |

## VI. COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES

### A. Formal Breach Notice (To Contractor)

```
Subject: Notice of Material Breach - NRSgirls.com Development Contract

Dear [Contractor Name/molohlove],

This notice is to inform you that your delivery under our agreement
for NRSgirls.com development constitutes a material breach of contract.

Specifically:
- The website delivered is a generic GoDaddy template, not custom
  Next.js development as specified
- None of the Phase I requirements were implemented
- No custom functionality, branding, or infrastructure was delivered

I am requesting immediate remedy in the form of:
[ ] Full refund of all payments made ($______)
[ ] Actual completion of contracted work within [X] days

Please respond within 72 hours to indicate how you intend to resolve
this matter. Failure to respond will result in escalation through
Fiverr's dispute resolution process and pursuit of all available
legal remedies.

[Your Name]
[Date]
```

### B. Fiverr Dispute Description

```
ORDER NOT AS DESCRIBED - COMPLETE NON-DELIVERY

I ordered custom web development for NRSgirls.com including:
- Custom Next.js frontend
- User registration forms
- Age verification system
- Brand integration with logo and tagline
- Payment infrastructure setup

Instead, I received:
- A generic GoDaddy Website Builder template
- No custom code whatsoever
- None of the specified features
- No branding or custom design

This is not a minor discrepancy - it is complete non-delivery.
The "delivered" website contains zero elements from the contracted
specifications. I have documentation proving the site is a
pre-built template with no custom development.

I am requesting a full refund.

[Attach evidence files]

### Option 2: Demand Contract Completion
**When to choose:** Contractor shows willingness; prefer continuity
- Issue formal cure notice (72-hour response deadline)
- Require milestone checkpoints with holdback
- Demand code repository access
- Proceed only with verified deliverables

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
**When to choose:** Partial refund acceptable; want to preserve some relationship
