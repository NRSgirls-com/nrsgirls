Business Plan â€” Executive Summary

Mission

Build a community-forward music platform that enables DJs to distribute mixes and performers to control their presence and privacy, while generating sustainable revenue to support platform operations and community programming.

Revenue model

- Tips & micro-payments: listeners tip DJs/performers per mix or session.
- Subscriptions: premium discovery features for listeners and enhanced analytics for DJs.
- Venue & event partnerships: referral fees and ticketing integrations.
- Merch & affiliate sales: optional channels for creators.

Scaling to 3% market-share (illustrative)

Assuming a target segment of the independent electronic/live-mix market, the path to 3% involves phased geographic expansion, focused artist acquisition campaigns, and partnerships with local venues and communities.
