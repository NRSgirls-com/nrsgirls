NRS Girls Platform — 19-Year Vision

This document outlines a 19-year vision for the NRS Girls Platform: a safe, sustainable, and community-led music platform that empowers DJs, performers, and audiences while preserving privacy and protecting rights.

Year 1-3: Establish the core platform — reliable upload and streaming, robust moderation, and clear privacy controls for performers. Build trust with a local community-first launch in Fresno and the Central Valley.

Year 4-7: Expand regionally, add monetization features for DJs and performers (tips, subscriptions, paid mixes), and formalize partnerships with community organizations and local venues.

Year 8-12: Grow national reach, invest in content discovery and recommendation, enable micro-licensing and rights management tools to reduce legal friction for mixed tracks.

Year 13-19: Mature into a sustainable cultural institution and technology platform, stewarding equitable revenue-sharing, supporting creative careers, and returning value to the community. Maintain an ethical technology posture with privacy-by-design and transparent governance.

Core principles

- Performer privacy: granular controls enabling anonymity or selective disclosure.
- Community stewardship: local governance and reinvestment in grassroots arts.
- Legal-first approach: proactive rights clearance, clear Terms of Service, and moderation that respects creators.

This vision is aspirational and will be refined iteratively with community feedback and legal guidance.
