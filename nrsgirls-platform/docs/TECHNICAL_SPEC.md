Technical Specification â€” Summary

This document captures core features and technical decisions for the initial platform.

Primary features

- DJ enrollment and dashboard: secure sign-up, profile, mix upload, metadata tagging, and analytics.
- Performer profiles: optional profiles, privacy controls (anonymity toggle, pseudonyms, selective exposure), and content claim management.
- Upload processing: MP3 validation, virus scanning, fingerprinting, and rights metadata capture.
- Moderation workflows: automated scanning, human review queues, takedown procedures, and appeals.
- Streaming: scalable streaming architecture with CDN-backed delivery, adaptive bitrate support, and multistream integration notes.
- API: RESTful endpoints for all functionality, token-based auth (JWT), role-based access control.
- Database: relational schema for users, DJs, performers, mixes, play history, and payments.
- Security: input validation, rate limiting, file-type verification, and background processing for heavy tasks.

Implementation considerations

- Backend: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI recommended; containerized services.
- Storage: S3-compatible object store for assets and a relational database (Postgres) for structured data.
- CI/CD: Automated tests, linting, container builds, and staged deployments (staging, production).

Open items

- DRM and licensing integration approach for mixed content.
- Exact schema for rights-holders and contributor attribution for mixes.

This document is intended as a high-level starting point; detailed API contracts and database migrations will follow in dedicated design tasks.
