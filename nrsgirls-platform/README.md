NRS Girls Platform

Overview

This directory contains the initial scaffold for the nrsgirls-platform project: a modern web platform connecting DJs and performers while preserving performer privacy and legal safety. It includes drafted documentation, frontend and backend stubs, deployment manifests, scripts, and placeholder brand assets so contributors can iterate quickly.

Structure

- docs/: Vision, team, technical specification, legal memo, and business plan.
- frontend/: Homepage, DJ and performer portals, and shared components.
- backend/: API endpoints, database schema, security scanning, and streaming integration notes.
- brand-assets/: Placeholder directories for logos and color schemes with a style guide.
- deployment/: Docker and hosting configuration and infrastructure notes.
- scripts/: Setup and deployment automation.

Tone: Professional â€” content is drafted to reflect the NRS Group of Fresno's formal, community-focused voice.

Notes

- This scaffold uses placeholders for binary assets; add real images and logos into brand-assets/logos/.
- No secrets are included. See .env.example for required environment variables.
